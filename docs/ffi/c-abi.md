# Experimental C ABI

`operon-core` exposes a small C-compatible ABI for hosts that cannot link the
Rust API directly. It is intentionally a command/event driver: the host keeps
control of models, SQLite, files, platform permissions, cancellation, and
network access.

The public header is
[`operon_core.h`](../../crates/operon-core/include/operon_core.h). Build the
dynamic and static libraries with:

```bash
make build-c-abi
```

On macOS this produces `liboperon_core.dylib` and `liboperon_core.a` under
`target/release/`; other platforms use their native dynamic-library extension.

## Apple packaging

Build a distributable Apple artifact with:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
make build-apple-xcframework
```

This creates `artifacts/OperonCore.xcframework` with arm64 iPhone and universal
arm64/x86_64 Simulator static-library slices, each carrying the public header.
The artifact is intentionally ignored by Git. A release process can sign and
publish the resulting XCFramework without changing the C ABI.

To compile-link every packaged slice against the public C header (without
requiring a device), run:

```bash
make verify-apple-xcframework
```

## Ownership

- `operon_session_create` returns an opaque handle; destroy it exactly once with
  `operon_session_destroy`.
- `operon_session_start` and `operon_session_resume` allocate returned JSON and
  error strings; free each with `operon_string_free`.
- `operon_abi_version` returns a library-owned static string that must not be
  freed.
- A null `config_json` selects default configuration. `out_step_json` is
  required for start/resume; `out_error` is optional.

## Command loop

```text
host creates session
  → operon_session_start
  → { kind: "command", command: { kind: "generate" | "retrieve" | ... } }
host performs that native operation
  → operon_session_resume(event JSON)
  → next command or { kind: "complete", result: ... }
```

Commands, events, and completed results retain their versioned JSON protocol
shape. The ABI only adds an outer `{kind: command|complete}` envelope.

The repository includes `OperonCoreFFI` and `OperonCoreDriver`. Together they
create this handle, execute Rust `generate` and `retrieve` commands through
app-owned Swift providers, and resume the core with versioned event envelopes.
An Apple host can use Apple Foundation Models for generation and its own local
store for grounding. Typed Swift callers can return application validation
errors through `output_validated`; Rust uses them for bounded targeted repair.
Memory-command routing is intentionally not enabled yet.
The C ABI itself has no database, inference, filesystem, or network authority.

## Status

This is an experimental `0.1` ABI. Its handle lifecycle and JSON envelope are
covered by Rust and Swift command-loop tests. The Swift bridge links a local
macOS dynamic library for development and a locally generated iOS XCFramework.
Release packaging and a cross-language replay suite remain before a stable ABI
release.
